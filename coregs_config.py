# This file exists to tell COREGS where GRAPS and Temoa live.

# These are the default locations for GRAPS and Temoa
# If you run the `get_graps_temoa.py` script, this is where they will be and
# you should not need to update these values.
# However, if you installed these programs in different locations, you could change
# these and COREGS will use those locations instead.
